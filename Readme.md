**`Digital Craftsman (Student/Cybersecurity/Digital-Forensics)`**

As a student persuing my Master's in CyberSecurity and Digital-Forensics, I'm excited to apply my theoretical knowledge and practical experience in the cyber forensic industry. With a strong background in forensic science, I'm eager to expand my knowledge in the rapidly evolving field of cybercrime investigations. I'm particularly interested in how forensic science can be used to recover, analyse, and interpret digital evidence. I've self studied digital forensics, which includes topics like file systems, network protocols, and cybercrime investigations.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Varshith's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I began my journey as a curious forensic science student, eager to dive into the world of programming, Linux, and networking. While I was honing my skills in digital forensics and cyber security, I also explored the world of coding, reverse engineering, and incident response. Alongside this, I taught myself shell scripting and Python with the ultimate goal of developing my own tool to analyze digital forensic evidence.

My passion for networking and malware analysis grew, and I found myself balancing multiple interests‚Äîgraphic design, photography, and hacking. But despite all these pursuits, one thing always stayed with me: the desire to create something meaningful, a tool that could truly make a difference in the field of cyber security and forensics.

While I've enjoyed honing my craft in various creative fields, it's time to return to that core goal‚Äîthe tool I've dreamed of building since I began this journey. Now, I'm ready to shift my focus and pour my energy into making that vision a reality, leveraging everything I've learned along the way. It's time to get back to the challenge that excites me the most.

In 2024, I‚Äôll be streamlining my efforts, dedicating myself to building a powerful forensic analysis tool, just as I once envisioned. I'm ready for this next chapter.
